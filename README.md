<p>If you enter 14, output will show "Not eligible to vote!".</p>
<p>For the second file you can add and remove things by arr.push and arr.pop.</p>
<p>If you add any new value to the array, it will show there when you run the code.</p>
<h3>Anyone wanted to add more creative to it are most welcome like adding more things to eligibility code like if you are putting age as 14, it will show you will be eligible after 4 years.</h3>
